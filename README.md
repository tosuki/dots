# Dots
Those are my dotfiles, nowadays i usually use those applications:
- Openbox as a floating window manager due to how easy is to customize it
- Alacritty as terminal emulator
- Vim and VSCODE as text editor 
- macOS cursor
- Qutebrowser as web browser due to its keyboard driven oriented


# Install
## Arch Linux
```
git clone http://github.com/tosuki/dots
cd dots
./install
```
## Any other distro
Good luck!
